The reason was sadly out of either of our control, since he was just missing the feelings. <br>It was unfortunate, but it was a very healthy relationship for me and him, and I hope I can move on from this soon.<br> I kind of also wanted to make this so I could lead people to a place where I talk about it, so I could just distract myself from the whole thing. <br>And when I am ready, I hope I can get my best friend back since that was the role he had for me before all this.<br> And I still trust him more than anyone else, so keeping my hopes up that my feelings pass rather sooner than later. :P<br> <br>Anyhow, that is mostly all I want to talk about today otherwise, I am developing a game in my college that should be done soon nothing big,<br> just a small wave shooter in a historic setting. <br>Alright, that's it from me! <br> This shoutout goes out to my friend Microwave, who listened to me write this blog <br>I love you all.<br> ~Nachi the Protogen~"

        "content": "Okay, I haven't been on this blog in a while so this is gona be a long one folks. The last 2 months were the worst months of my life due to a breakup and from what I got told by professionals that it seems like I now carry a trauma from it. From mood swings to suicidal thoughts, it was pretty much all there, a horrific time that makes me ask if us dating was even worth it. To go in deeper the entire breakup itself was caused to a from my understanding 'lack of feelings' and this simply broke me for a week before we even broke up basically gave me attachment issues since I was lead on to believe that everything would be fine. But a thing I noticed was that the real disinterest in me was observable ever since he got his new friend group. Without the knowledge of what's happening on his side it just made me believe that I was replaced. With or without intention it just broke me further and then an incident happened apparently in that group that made me feel like that's the most likely conclusion I can draw from it. With that as any young ex couple would we tried to stay friends but due to that trauma I felt like it was impossible for me to try it cause it never ended well when we tried. Just so that I get tolled that the way I tried to find help with a mutual friend of mine was something that rubbed him the wrong way. For context due to the attachment issues I got from him I talked with that mutual friend a lot about our breakup. So much in fact that he sometimes needed a break from me. So that was apparently so bad that he didn't want to have anything to do with me anymore and as much as I wanted to end the friendship anyway that just felt like a nippicky slap in the face coming from someone where I had to show way more acceptance for past actions he took. Overall, our relationship was great but the breakup after left me in trauma, tears and lost for what's next. This vent comes from the desire to finally lose what I kept piling up in me for the last 2 months and I just can't anymore. I hope I can focus on new passions, new people and just something else. I'm so drained from this emotional rollercoaster, I just want to be done with it.<br> Much Love <br>Nachi"

        "content": "Today would have been a very special day if my life went according to plan. Unfortunately, this is not going to be how I will start this. On the 5th of September, I met the most Important and close person in my life. This would have been how it could have started, but unfortunately bridges have been cut, and life didn't go the way that would have made an outcome that would have started this blog like this, so let's cut to it: what happened? <h1> Beginning </h1> I used to be on a Furry Server Called 'Mega's Furry Hotel' due to me meeting the owner in VR Chat. It was a pretty interesting server that I kind of ignored for the first week I was on it, and then I randomly decided to interact on it. The people there were very diverse, and a lot of stories were made, one of them was how I met a Friend during that time that I didn't think of much back then. Their Name was Snowy, a person that I at the time only met through them randomly asking people to DM him for shit's and giggles. It wasn't anything special; we had a few conversations and sometimes VC'd, but ultimately, at the time, they were too loud for me to actively talk with. A bit more time went by, and at one point I became a mod on that server. Some time after that, we created a Minecraft server for that Discord, in which I grew closer to pretty much everyone who participated, mostly a Friend named Keiko and, as mentioned before, Snowy. We had a pretty sleek base somewhere off Spawn, and we kind of just grew closer with them over the times we played. A Key thing that happened in between was that I fell for the owner Mega and tried to get with them, which they agreed to, but I ended up getting dumped about 4 days later, making me spend way more time with my friends on the server, including for this story Snowy. Sometimes later, since I was pretty close with them, I fell for Snowy, something I intended at the time not to engage in since we have a continental distance between us, but I thought I might as well try due to these feelings just being very, very strong. Which led to about 2 weeks of me waiting for an answer from him. In my memory, it was a good few weeks since he at the time made sure that I was okay and that stuff didn't get to me too much. And in the end, we ended up dating due to this. <h1> The Start </h1> With that, we were pretty private about all of it at the start since I was in a higher Position on that server, and things went okay. The First few months were pretty healthy, with not many bad things happening, but a thing I noted was that feeling strong at the start just made things fade very very quickly, leading me into a time when I started to neglect him more and more. It's an error that came, especially since I was not in a relationship for 3 years due to my last one being pretty abusive, leaving me scared of that. It doesn't improve that behavior, but it explains where it comes from. At that time, the server we were on also became more inactive, leading me to leave it sometimes later, and like 10 minutes later, the owner wanted to get rid of the server and did so. Anyhow, with my bad behavior towards him, he ended up breaking up with me due to me not being a good boyfriend at the time and just being very self-centered overall. This Originally didn't hit me much, but like a day or so after I noticed how much or a big part he was for me. I was in a very bad state, and he was pretty much the only one who could bring me comfort, leading to one of the closest friendships I ever had. Unfortunately that came from a broken heart, and with that, it was not something very natural as I reflect on it now. I tried to improve as a person a lot and tried to show that I was making mistakes and wanted to improve, leading me to ask him out again. With that, I got back into a time of waiting, where he obviously saw how I was improving and treating him well and with respect, but he was also indecisive about whether he could let himself love me. I was also getting into more of a heartbroken state, leading me to pressure him into making a decision. And in the end, he did end up giving me another shot. <h1> The beginning of the end </h1> I won't explain every detail of how our relationship went, but it is very safe to say that it was a good one. There is a big difference between what we used to have and me being way more compassionate and committed. It was something good and something to hold on to. That is what I thought and believed. I tried my best for it, and that's all I could really offer. Now that the good parts are much more prevalent, it will sound very rough from here on, so I will just mention something. I don't regret a single thing, what we had was in general good and something that I will learn from and improve off of for my Future, and I hope he does too. At some point he just lost his feelings or the motivation to keep going, to move along and stay committed. Why? I couldn't tell you if it could have been through the messy start or just a rough time, but I think I can only make so many assumptions about it since I know that he doesn't know any better either. It was something that was very hard since he wanted to keep going since, by his words, I do anything he expects from a partner or that I am perfect. But unfortunately, without that love, it was pretty much a lost cause. It leads us to split, a very hard split since, as much as I could tell that it was my fault during our first attempt, this is just life fucking us over. <h1> The Aftermath </h1> I went down a very bad pit. It was the worst time of my life since, as any young person could tell, a relationship is a big part of your life when anything else hasn't really started. What I can say is that our breakup was very poor and very rough. I was very attached to him since he was the biggest part of my life and something that kept me going. As before mentioned, even without a relationship, he was my closest and best friend. This happened pretty much at the start of my summer holidays, so those were pretty much ruined for me. Life is not fair, and I had a very hard time grieving what I lost. I wanted him back as a friend so bad since he was my center of attention, but I just was not mature enough for that at the time. My feelings went wild, and I was on an emotional roller coaster, everything being just so strange and so lonely, which led to any conversation with him being very explosive. A breakup can be very traumatic, and for me, it left a scar—a trauma that makes even thinking of that time dreadful. I was very certain that, with a trauma, I couldn't try to have him as a friend, since that was a lost cause for me. What hurt me then was that he said he didn't want a friendship either, because of how explosive my feelings were. I was very insulted at the time, going along the lines of that he caused that and that this was feeling like a slap in the face, but he was right in the end. It led me to do some very stupid things that potentilly lead to buring more bridges than I wanted to. Leading me to not just lose him but also another Friend who was like a brother to me. This all just sounds very bad, and I know it is since it was the worst time of my life, but I feel way better now. <h1> Conclusion </h1> In the end, I don't regret meeting you, Snowy; our time was good, and I wouldn't regret it. However, I do feel a massive regret for the burned bridges that I left. For our mutual friend, I lost due to my poor emotions and how much I wish I could tell him that I am sorry about everything and that I want to make things right. I don't know if I get that luxury. I wish I could get it, of course, but in the end, I don't know if I will get that luxury with our mutual friend or ex mutual friend. In the end, no matter if you are still in my life or not, I will learn from this, go on with my work as a programmer, and improve upon my Art as a Hobby. As much as I hope that we will once again see each other or that the burned bridges can be fixed, I hope you know that I appreciate you.  <h1> Thank you to the reader </h1> <br> <br> This was my post for the original anniversary of where I met Snowy. Thank you to anyone who read this. I appreciate it a lot, and it took me a while to publish this, just as it took me a lot of strength to write. As you noticed, today is actually not the 5th since I wanted to publish this now so that I could move on with my life a bit sooner, so sorry if it is a bit misleading. <br> If you ever want to reach out to me, my Discord tag is shadow_nachi. <br> This marks a new chapter for me and should suffice to end this era. <br> I am thankful for all my friends who bore with my emotions and everyone who I met through this. <br> I hope you all have an amazing day <br> Chris "

So my life took a full swing from how it used to be. I got into Art and my passion for coding is sitting back since I have a big code burn phase rn. I got into rain world, a very difficult indi game, but one that is very nice to play with a certain Friend who kinda became my mentor in art. And to have the biggest change apparent, I still miss a certain someone... It is insane to me how long these feelings linger, but my life got significantly worse without them, and I really miss how things used to be. All the attention I get through art will never replace the love I felt to be with them. In the end, I got betrayed and screwed over. I gave it my all and still ended up in a pit. My life sucks, and I hate the passion I'm missing and everything that I used to have being gone. Being filled with mixed emotions like anger, sadness, love and sorrow is just fucking with me, no matter what. I miss you Holden and my old life, and I can only admit to saying it because it will never be what it once was... <br><br>in love and sorrow <br>Nachi"

I have a new sona or well not new, but I made my Protogen a shark!(thank you to Dex who made the ref :P). I have also been very much getting into art a lot and found a lot of passion in it. Furthermore, I also figured that my focus in development is probably gone to be in databases, cause those heavily intrigue me. Otherwise, I hope I can find my internship soon that is supposed to be in 6 months from now and hopefully join the workforce after 2 more years or school. Anyway no big details just an update cause this blog has been very much a venting pot for a while now so I wanted it to look less bad so ya. <br> Sincerely <br> Nachi the Sharkogen"

        "content": " Hello again lads! <br> <br> Long time no see, and it has been indeed a fuck long time, so I got some news! <br> So firstly I went out of the winter holidays which were a much-needed break, and it got me back into Warframe of all games! So with that I went to school again and oh shit what's that? Our train system completely fucked itself and said 'No transport because we make our tracks electrified' or something along those lines. And it has been a horror to travel there recently. Sometimes my Bus doesn't come and sometimes I ltr can't arrive at time, so I am pretty much fucked either way. Other than that, I am realizing more and more how much I hate the German education system and how it teaches you jack shit about life and just tells you to shut up and do a task that will be grated. Considering how inefficient our teachers in particular are, it just makes me mad that I travel so long to get my ass over there so that they teach me barrel anything about IT, and then I fuck up in exams because we don't have simple tools like language compatibility. The only thing we get is syntax highlighting which doesn't work with HTML strings and then if you are stuck in an exam you can't debug easily because of the retardation of the schooling system. It is horrific, and I'd prefer to just work and learn that way, but in this industry you need a qualification by a school, and it really makes me question how the fuck that school is able to tell me I qualified for this if they teach me barely anything about it and I learn most of it by myself. Questions over questions and if it goes by me, I'd be long gone from there but guess where mys only chance lies to get a job in IT here...<br>Anyhow to be more positive I found an internship in a company about developing web apps so I have a lot of hope for that! And I mean even tho school makes me sick I am still learning on my own even tho it is sad how I have to take care of that while going to an institution about teaching shit. <br> But yea that is how I'm doing fuck my school, fuck my teachers and fuck you Deutsche Bahn(And I love you Warframe <3) <br> <br> Yours Truly <br> Nachi"
